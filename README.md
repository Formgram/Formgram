# Formgram
Create forms and form fields in a free database then render them on the page and save information typed into those fields back into the free database.

You can see the list of all the available forms at http://formgram5.azurewebsites.net/m/forms.aspx

If you don't already have an account with formgram, you can register for free or log in as a one-time guest to view all the forms.

In the next release, you'll be able to create your own forms.
