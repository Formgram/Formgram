# Formgram
Use this set of web services to create forms and form fields in a free database then display the form and save information typed into those fields back into the free database.

You can see the list of all the currently available forms at http://formgram5.azurewebsites.net/m/Forms.aspx?formListEnum=1&username=guest

Once you find the form you'd like to use, get the multipage_form_id of that form from the URL that shows up on your browser. For example, multipage_form_id of the HK Computer Services form is 10488
http://formgram5.azurewebsites.net/m/OpenForm.aspx?multipage_form_id=10488&username=guest

In the next release, you'll be able to create your own forms and other apps/people can use your new forms too.

In the meantime, fell free to email me at henry@formgram.com with an example of a form you'd like created and I'll create it for you to use.
