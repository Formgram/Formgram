# Formgram
Create forms and form fields in a free database then display the form and save information typed into those fields back into the free database.

You can see the list of all the currently available forms at http://formgram5.azurewebsites.net/m/Forms.aspx?formListEnum=1&username=guest


In the next release, you'll be able to create your own forms and other apps/people can use them too.
